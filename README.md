# JSONLearning

JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format used for storing and transmitting data. It's a text-based format derived from a subset of JavaScript syntax. JSON is widely used for web applications, particularly when exchanging data between a server and a web page. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
# Key Features of JSON: 
Lightweight and Readable:
JSON is designed to be compact and easy for both humans and machines to understand. 
Text-Based:
It uses plain text to represent data, making it suitable for various applications. 
Language-Independent:
While based on JavaScript syntax, JSON is not tied to any specific programming language. 
Data Structures:
JSON uses objects (unordered collections of name/value pairs) and arrays (ordered lists of values) to represent data. 
# Common Uses: 
Web Applications: Used to transmit data between servers and web pages. 
APIs: Many APIs use JSON to exchange data. 
Configuration Files: JSON can be used for storing application settings. 
Data Storage: JSON databases, like those using MongoDB, store data in JSON format.
